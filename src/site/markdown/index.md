## About

vaadin-container-utils is a util library to facilitate the creation of Containers.

It currently contains two main classes to use :

* __ContainerUtils__ : Utils class useful for common and generic operation on Container such as initialize, add a property, etc.
* __ContainerFactory__ : Create different type of Container from a list of Bean using different algorithm to get the list of properties.

It also contains a ``@Container`` annotation to easily annotate your beans for behavior 
in creating ]Vaadin](http://vaadin.com) containers. The corresponding ``PropertyReaderAlogrithm``
is then ``AnnotationReaderAlgorithm``.

The goals when creating this library is to ease the creation of different type of containers,
while still have a maximum flexibility. Before having a ``1.0`` version, there is a lot of
improvement to push (_Pivotable_ containers, better customization, etc.).
